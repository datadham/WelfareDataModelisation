# WelfareDataModelisation

Welcome to my portfolio! During my research journey, I embarked on a fascinating project focused on modeling human metabolism and applying advanced artificial intelligence methods to create predictive models of well-being. My study centered on an extensive database comprising no less than 71,000 individuals, allowing for comprehensive multi-dimensional analysis.

The central aim of this thesis was to gain an in-depth understanding of the complex interactions between human metabolism and well-being, utilizing advanced modeling techniques and artificial intelligence. Through a detailed exploration of this massive dataset, I sought to identify trends, correlations, and key factors influencing individuals' well-being.

This project has been an exciting endeavor, merging biology, data science, and AI to offer fresh and valuable insights into how our metabolism may impact our well-being. The predictive models I developed have potential applications in the fields of health, disease prevention, and improving quality of life.

I invite you to delve further into this project in my portfolio, where you will discover the details of my methodology, the fascinating results I achieved, and the potential implications of this research for our understanding of human metabolism and well-being. I hope this exploration inspires you as much as it has inspired me.
